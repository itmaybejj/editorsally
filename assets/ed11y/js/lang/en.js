  LINK_SUS_ALT: `<p>This image's alt text includes the word "%(alt)," which usually means the alt is not describing the link destination.</p><p>Alt text: "<strong>%(ALT_TEXT)</strong>"</p><p>To fix: make sure this alt is the link's destination or purpose. <br></strong></p>${why.imageLinks}`,
  LINK_SYMBOLS: `<p>Symbol found: <strong {C}>%(ERROR)</strong></p>${why.fix}Avoid using symbols as calls to action within link text unless they are hidden from assistive technologies. Screen readers may read the symbols out loud, which can be confusing.</p>`,
  LINK_URL: `<p>${why.fix}Change this link to the title of its destination or purpose.</p><div class="why"><p>Readers skim for links by name. This is especially true of screen reader users, who navigate and search using a list of on-page links.</p><p>Linked URLs cannot be skimmed or found by in-page searches, so people are less likely to find them and less likely to click them.</p></div>`,
  META_LANG: `<p>${why.fix}Add a <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-html-language-declarations">language attribute on the page HTML tag</a>.</p><div class="why"><p>Tip: screen readers pronounce words using language tags. Pronouncing a language with the wrong language pack produces unintelligible speech. If your language is not tagged, the screen reader will either use the browser's default language or try to guess, with unpredictable results.</p></div>`,
  META_REFRESH: `<p>Pages should not automatically refresh using a meta tag. This interrupts the user without warning or the ability to prevent refresh, makes them lose their place while reading, and can reset form progress.</p><p>${why.fix}To refresh content on the same page, use AJAX to refresh sections in place without a reload, or use JavaScript to trigger the reload, so the user can be warned first and have the option to delay the event.</p>`,
  META_TITLE: `<p>${why.fix}Add a <code>&lt;title&gt</code> tag to the page's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element.</p><div class="why"><p>Many parts of the browsing experience depend on a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/title">short and unique title tag</a>:</p><ul><li>Search engines use it to title results.</li><li>Browsers use it to title tabs.</li><li>Screen readers speak it when switching tabs.</li></ul><p>Without a page title, people see/hear a raw URL instead.</p></div>`,
  MISSING_ALT: `<p>When screen readers encounter an image with no alt attribute at all, they dictate the url of the image file instead, often one letter at a time.</p>	<p>${why.fix}Either add an empty alt (alt="") to indicate this image should be ignored by screen readers, or add descriptive alt text.</p>${why.images}`,
  MISSING_ALT_LINK: `<p>When screen readers encounter an image with no alt attribute at all, they dictate the url of the image file instead, often one letter at a time. This is especially a problem for linked images.</p><p>${why.fix}Add alt text that matches the link's destination.</p>${why.imageLinks} `,
  MISSING_ALT_LINK_HAS_TEXT: `<p>This image is part of a link with text. If the visible text is sufficient to describe the link, add an empty alt (alt="") to tell screen readers to ignore this image. Otherwise, add an alt that describes the link's destination or purpose.</p>${why.imageLinks}`,
  QA_BAD_LINK: `<p>Link appears to point to a development environment:<br>{L} <strong {C}>%(LINK)</strong></p><p>${why.fix}Change this to point a relative path (/folder) or the public URL.</p>`,
  QA_BLOCKQUOTE: `<p>Blockquote formatting tells screen readers that the text should be announced as a quotation. Short blockquotes are often actually headings.</p><p>${why.fix}If this is a heading and not a quotation, use heading formatting instead, so it appears in the page outline.</p>${why.headings}`,
  QA_DOCUMENT: `<p>Linked documents are considered web content and must be made accessible as well. Check that this document has tagged its headings, table headers and image alt text.</p><div class="why"><ul><li>Make your <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6199477?hl=en">Google Workspace document or presentation more accessible.</a></li><li>Make your <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-accessible-office-documents-868ecfcd-4f00-4224-b881-a65537a7c155">Office documents more accessible.</a></li></ul></div>`,
  // Updated
  QA_FAKE_HEADING: `<p>${why.fix}If this all-bold line of text introduces a topic, replace the visual-only bold formatting with a heading style.</p><div class="why"> <p>Tip: headings and subheadings create a navigable table of contents for assistive devices. The heading's <strong><em>number</em></strong> indicates its <strong><em>depth</em></strong> in the page outline; e.g.:</p><ul><li>Heading level 1<ul><li>Heading level 2: a topic<ul><li>Heading level 3: a subtopic</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul> </div>`,
  QA_FAKE_LIST: `<p>${why.fix}If this "%(text)" is part of a list, replace it with list formatting.</p><div class="why"><p>List formatting is structural, both visually and navigationally:</p> <ol><li>Lists align their indents for easy reading.</li> <li>Lists are machine-readable. Screen readers orient their users by regularly announcing their position in the list ("item 3 of 7").</li></ol> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. But a sentence with a number in front of it like this does not indent its second line on overflow, and is not included in the count of items for screen reader users.</p></div> `,
  QA_IN_PAGE_LINK: `<p>The link target does not match any elements on this page.</p><div class="why"><p>Note for developers: if this not a normal link, and the link target is a placeholder for a JavaScript event, make sure to test that it works when clicked with a keyboard before adding this to the checker ignore list.</p></div>`,
  QA_JUSTIFY: `<p>Justified text inserts extra spaces to align paragraphs to both the left and right margins. The irregular gaps from line to line make the text more difficult to read for many people.</p><p>${why.fix}Use left-aligned text.</p>`,
  QA_NESTED_COMPONENTS: "Avoid nesting interactive layout components, such as placing accordions within other accordions, or placing tabs inside accordions and vice versa. This can complicate navigation, increase cognitive overload, and lead to people overlooking content.",
  QA_PDF: `<p>${why.fix}Do one of the following:</p><ul><li>Link to a Web page instead,</li><li><em>Also</em> link to a Web page or editable document, so this PDF is only the "printable" option, or</li><li>At a minumum make sure this PDF readable with screen readers by <a href='https://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/' target='_blank'>manually checking that it has been tagged</a> with headings, column reading order, table headers, and alt text.</li>	</ul>	<div class="why"><p>Mobile and assistive device users almost universally prefer Web pages to PDFs. PDFs do not reflow for mobile devices, and are often missing tags that must be present to navigate their text with screen readers.</p></div>`,
  // Updated
  QA_SMALL_TEXT: "Small text is harder to read, particularly for those with low vision. To ensure better readability, avoid using font sizes smaller than the default.",
  QA_STRONG_ITALICS: `<p>${why.fix}Reserve bold and italic for key words and phrases.</p><div class="why"><p>Note: if this is a quotation, the blockquote tag can be used to set it apart.</div>`,
  QA_SUBSCRIPT: `Subscript and superscript formatting makes text too small to be easily read for many people. It should only be used for individual words or phrases, such as ordinal numbers (4<sup>th</sup>), chemical formulas (H<sub>2</sub>O) and references to footnotes.`,
  QA_UNDERLINE: `<p>Underlined text on the Web indicates a link, not emphasized text. Users will think they can click this.</p><p>${why.fix} Use <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italic</em> for emphasis, and tag text as headings to mark topic changes.</p><div class="why"><p>Note: screen readers do not announce visual-only formatting like underlines. Only headings add text to the page outline.</p></div>`,
  QA_UPPERCASE: `<p>LARGE BLOCKS OF UPPERCASE TEXT ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO READ, AND ARE OFTEN INTERPRETED AS SHOUTING.</p><p>${why.fix}Only emphasize a few words at a time, preferably via bold formatting rather than caps lock.</p><div class="why"><p>Note: screen readers do not announce visual only formatting like bold text. Use a heading style instead if this emphasized text introduces a topic change or critically important content.</p></div>`,
  SUS_ALT: `<p>This image's alt text includes the word "%(alt)," which is probably redundant.</p><p>Alt text: "<strong>%(ALT_TEXT)</strong>"</p><p><strong class="badge">To fix</strong> Reword the alt to briefly convey what the image means.</p><div class="why"><p>Tip: screen readers announce they are describing an image when reading alt text, so phrases like "image of" and "photo of" are usually redundant; the screen reader user hears <em>"Image of something, Image."</em></p><p>Note that this is OK if the words refer to content inside the image:</p><ul><li>Not redundant: "<em>A photo in</em> a photo album being shown to the class."</li><li>Redundant: "<em>Photo of</em> a photo in a photo album being show to the class."</li></ul></div>`,
  TABINDEX_ATTR: `<p>${why.fix}Never use tabindex values greater than "0" (the default order). Change the order of elements in the HTML instead, so tab order and reading order stay the same.</p><div class="why"><p>Tip: by default, the visual order, the order keyboards tab through elements, and the order screen readers announce elements are all the same.</p><p>Assigning a positive tabindex to an element moves it to the beginning of the tab order, <strong>but not the visual or reading order</strong>. Assistive device users have to look for overridden buttons and form elements at opposite ends of the page from their labels and instructions.</p></div>`,
  TABLES_EMPTY_HEADING: `<p>${why.fix}Make sure each header cell contains text.</p><div class="why"><p>Tip: screen readers use headers to orient users as they explore a table. The relevant header repeats as the cursor enters each column or row.</p></div>`,
  TABLES_MISSING_HEADINGS: `<p>${why.fix}Edit the table's properties and specify whether headers have been placed in the first row, column or both.</p><div class="why"> <p>Tip: screen readers use headers to orient users as they explore a table. The relevant header repeats as the cursor enters each column or row.</p><p>If this table has no headers because it is only being used for visual layout, remove the table formatting and use visual-only column formatting instead.</p></div> `,
  TABLES_SEMANTIC_HEADING: `<p>${why.fix}Remove this heading (h2, h3) formatting. Provide header rows and columns instead. If you need multiple header rows, break this into more than one table.</p><div class="why"> <p>Tip: Table headers are directional: one row or column. Content headings label all subsequent text, even in unrelated columns:</p><table><tr><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><td rowspan="2">A <strong>table header</strong> in cell 2 labels cell B. <br><br> A <strong>content heading</strong> in cell 2 labels cells 3, A, B and C, as well as this text and this tooltip's footer.</td></tr> <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td></table> </div>`
